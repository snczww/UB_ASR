# WER Calculation with Strategy Pattern

This repository provides a flexible framework for calculating Word Error Rate (WER) using different strategies. The implementation uses the Strategy design pattern to allow for easy swapping of WER calculation methods depending on your needs. 

## Features

- Calculate WER by treating input lists as whole texts.
- Calculate WER line by line.
- Calculate WER based on annotations (both as whole texts and line by line).
- Provides support for fixed annotations and custom tokenization strategies.
- Uses Hugging Face's `AutoTokenizer` for tokenization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Other utility functions such as `collect_all_matches` and `word_list_error_rate`

You can install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install transformers
